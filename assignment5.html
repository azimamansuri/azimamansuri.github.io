            <h1>Assignment 5: Silicone molds and casting </h1>
		<p> In this assignment, we were tasked to design and fabricate a 2-part silicone mold that we will later use
      to cast at least 4 identical parts (e.g. in plaster). This involves designing a master part in CAD (using Rhino) first, 
      then designing the mold, then designing a mold to cast the mold in.

		<p> I originally created a donut baking sheet mold but decided to pivot to something I'd use more. I've been learning 
			how to stamp prints with ink and using rubber sheets to create custom stamps and decided to try making a
			stamp mold with silicone to see if it would work similarly. My sister and I were looking into creating a 
			mediterranean theme for our rubber stamps, so I was inspired by turkish tile design for these stamps. I created
			the shapes in Rhino that created a similar tile pattern. 
		</p>
		
	<p> I created two boxes (one smaller than the other) and then used the booleandifference command to create the base tray.

	<p> I created a geometric pattern for the stamp shape - I decided to make my stamp double sided so I could use 
		two different designs on my prints.

	<p> I then added a tube to allow for the mold to be poured into the structure and added a sphere to help as support 
		between the two sides. For one side I used the BooleanUnion command and for the other side I used the 
		BooleanDifference command.

	<p> I then exported to Cura to print - the estimated time is 11 hours and 23 minutes. Two hours into the print,
		I started to hear a ticking sound near the bowden tube and the extruder was lifted instead of releasing filament after printing
		the initial layers. Tightening the screws around the tube entry point seemed to do the trick so hoping it prints all the way 
		through correctly.
