            <h1>Assignment 5: Silicone molds and casting </h1>
		<p> In this assignment, we were tasked to design and fabricate a 2-part silicone mold that we will later use
      to cast at least 4 identical parts (e.g. in plaster). This involves designing a master part in CAD (using Rhino) first, 
      then designing the mold, then designing a mold to cast the mold in.

		<p> Since I purchased the food safe material, I decided to create a mold for a donut baking sheet.
		</p>
		
	<p> I used the torus shape to create the inner molds and a box square to create the tray base.
		I then used a boolean difference to create the mold shape.

	<p> I then added tubes to allow for the mold to be poured into the structure and added a sphere to help as support 
		between the two sides. For one side I used the BooleanUnion command and for the other side I used the 
		BooleanDifference command.

	<p> This was the final result, which I will be sending over to Cura to set up printing.
