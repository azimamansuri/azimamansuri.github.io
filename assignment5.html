            <h1>Assignment 5: Silicone molds and casting </h1>
		<p> In this assignment, we were tasked to design and fabricate a 2-part silicone mold that we will later use
      to cast at least 4 identical parts (e.g. in plaster). This involves designing a master part in CAD (using Rhino) first, 
      then designing the mold, then designing a mold to cast the mold in.

		<p> I originally created a donut baking sheet mold but decided to pivot to something I'd use more. I've been learning 
			how to stamp prints with ink and using rubber sheets to create custom stamps and decided to try making a
			stamp mold with silicone to see if it would work similarly. My sister and I were looking into creating a 
			mediterranean theme for our rubber stamps, so I was inspired by turkish tile design for these stamps. I created
			the shapes in Rhino that created a similar tile pattern. 
		</p>
		
	<p> I created two boxes (one smaller than the other) and then used the booleandifference command to create the base tray. 
	 
	</p>

	<p> I created a geometric pattern for the stamp shape - I decided to make my stamp double sided so I could use 
		two different designs on my prints.
	 
	</p>

	<p> I then added a tube to allow for the mold to be poured into the structure and added a sphere to help as support 
		between the two sides. For one side I used the BooleanUnion command and for the other side I used the 
		BooleanDifference command.

	<p> I then exported to Cura to print - the estimated time was 11 hours and 23 minutes at high dynamic quality. Two hours into the print,
		I started to hear a ticking sound near the bowden tube and the extruder was lifted instead of releasing filament after printing
		the initial layers. Tightening the screws around the tube entry point seemed to do the trick initially but after restarting it
		3 times and having it run into layer issues in the 2nd hour, I realized that the filament had been cut before entering
		the bowden tube so I removed the filament entirely and replaced the nozzle and the filament. Testing it by putting the filament through 
		the hot end nozzle confirmed that that's where the issue was and it was now printing the filament properly. I restarted the print
		again, this time printing at standard quality that always worked well for me before. This worked, and the estimated time was 9 hours but it printed in 8 hours 
		and 45 minutes.

	<p> The prints came out great and the intricate details showed up pretty well. 
		Each of the sides of the stamp printed with the keys and side tube.

	<p> I then mixed the food safe oomoo (smooth sil 940) in the required portions (100A : 10B). 
	</p>

	<p> I realized after filling the mold that the tube I designed should have been longer to meet the inner box instead
		of just a circular cut out in the wall. Since I had created this cut out, the oomoo started to spill out through it, 
		so I used a piece of cardboard to block it from spilling out which solved the issue. The photo to the left shows the 
		mold before I had the cardboard to stop the overflow and the photo to the right shows the mold after placing the cardboard. 
		It will take 24 hours to cure.

	<p> After it cured, I cut a tube where the tube should have been in order to allow for the plaster to go into the mold.

	<p> I then mixed the plaster and cut pieces of cardboard to tape around the silicone mold into a sandwich form so that
		the plaster remains intact as it forms and solidifies. I then poured the plaster into the mold to set the structure. In order
		to keep it tightly bound, I used the clip I printed earlier to secure the cardboard in place (bonus points for #repurposing?)
