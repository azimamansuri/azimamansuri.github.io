            <h1>Assignment 7: Final project </h1>
		<p>For this assignment, we were tasked to use techniques learned all quarter to design, print, and create objects.

	<h2>Concept </h2>	
	<p> For my final project, I built off of the mediterranean tile concept I had for my molding project. 
		My sister and I are creating a print shop and are in the process of creating ink prints that would be 
		used as cards, posters or gifts. For the mold project, I created two turkish-inspired tile design molds 
		to be used as stamps. For this final project, I created a cohesive collection to fit this theme. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		I incorporated some arabic calligraphy/writing 
		into it as well to showcase the connectedness between the architecture, culture, and script of 
		the mediterranean, and found some inspiration online to create a moodboard:

		<p>
		Through this project, I want to experiment with different shapes and patterns that I can create through 
		different methods (rhino and grasshopper), and then print the mold which I plan to cast silicone into and then 
		plaster as a final piece. These objects would be used as stamps for these prints.

	<h2>Stamps </h2>
   <br>
  	<a href="/Final project/Stamp/arabicstamp.stl" download > Stamp STL (Download) </a>
		<a href="/Final project/Stamp/arabicstamp.3dm" download > Rhino (Download) </a>
		<a href="/Final project/Stamp/arabicstamp.3mf" download > Cura (Download) </a>
		<a href="/Final project/Stamp/arabicstamp.gcode" download > gcode (Download) </a>
    <br>
    
		<p> I wanted to expand the plaster stamp collection so I created another double sided stamp, this time experiementing with
    arabic calligraphy and a quote that reads "so where are you going" in arabic. I started by image tracing the vector 
    I found online and creating the design in Rhino using basic geometry.

    <p> I then exported the STL file to Cura and then sent it to print. 
		</p>
    <img src="/Final project/Stamp/stamp (printing).JPG" width=350>

    <p> It printed precisely in the first try and took about 9 hours.

    <p> I then mixed the silicone and set it to cure for 24 hours since it's the food-safe type and takes a full day to cure.

    <p>
    After it cured, I pulled it out and filled it with the plaster I mixed.

    <p> I then used stamping ink I had to dip the plaster stamp into and then created prints on watercolor paper that
    serve as cards and prints to place into fraes as gifts! These prototypes help inform how my sister and I will
    organize and build the shop!

	<h2>Planter </h2>
   <br>
  	<a href="/Final project/Planter/tile_planter.stl" download > Planter STL (Download) </a>
		<a href="/Final project/Planter/tile_planter.3dm" download > Rhino (Download) </a>
		<a href="/Final project/Planter/tile_planter.3mf" download > Cura (Download) </a>
		<a href="/Final project/Planter/tile_planter.gcode" download > gcode (Download) </a>
    <br>
  
		<p> As part of the collection, I decided to experiment with turkish tile prints on mini planters/candle holders. The end product
    would be plaster.
		</p>
    
    <p> I created the design entirely in Rhino and then exported to Cura for printing. 
    </p>
    <img src="/Final project/Planter/planter (rhino 1).png" width=230>
    <img src="/Final project/Planter/planter (rhino 2).png" width=230>
    <img src="/Final project/Planter/planter (cura).png" width=230>
    
    <p>The first print seemed to start fine but
    then ran into adhesion issues. The second showed issues a few hours in, and I stopped the print 10 hours into the 20 hour print. 
    I looked back at the preview for the Cura file because the design was totally off during printing, and noticed that the
    red marking indicated that there was an issue with the design of the tubes. 
    </p>
    <img src="/Final project/Planter/planter (failed 1).jpg" width=350>
    <img src="/Final project/Planter/planter (failed 2).jpg" width=350>
    
    <p> I ended up redesigning it without the tubes and 
    also made the walls thinner to reduce time and waste and reprinted it. The mold now takes 17 hours to print. It will take 24 to cure in silicone
    and then will be put into plaster to create the plaster planter.
