            <h1>Assignment 4: Meshes and lamps </h1>
		<p> In this assignment, we were tasked to 1) modify the mesh of two STLs to produce a single printable STL and 2) 
      create a lamp design that can easily fit to the innerds and be disassembled. 
    </p>

  <h3>Part 1: Meshes</h3>
		<p> For the first part of the assignment, I decided to solve a problem I often run into - carrying credit cards without needing a bag. I wanted to create a credit card clip that would 
			attach to a belt or pocket without falling or slipping out of my pocket. I found an STL for a belt clip and another STL for a credit card clip
			on Thingiverse and created a combined mesh as demonstrated in class.

		<br> 
		
		<p> First, I imported both STL files into Rhino. 
		</p>

		<p> I then placed them in the orientation that I wanted them to print in, overlapping a bit so the union would work. 
		</p>
		<img src="/Meshes/Meshes (placement).png" width=700>
		
		<p> Next, I used the Show Edges command to check that there were no naked edges that I would have to fill. Luckily, there
			were no naked edges and I could move to create a union as is!
		</p>
		<img src="/Meshes/Meshes (naked edges).png" width=700 >
		
		<p> Finally, I used the MeshBooleanUnion command to create a union between the two objects.  
		</p>
		<img src="/Meshes/Meshes (union).png" width=700 >
		
		
		<p> I then imported the STL into Cura to slice and convert to machine code to print. The estimated print time is 
			4 hours and 7 minutes (to be updated after print completes).

    <h3>Part 2: Lamp design </h3>
		<p> For the second part of the assignment, I designed a lamp to fit onto my existing hanging lamp I had gotten from Ikea.
			I wanted to create a simple, minimal, geometric shape for my lamp shade and create something that would 
			fit well with the warm tones of my room and desk. I also wanted to have some light shine through the shade to create 
			a pattern on the wall. 
		</p>

		<a href="/Lamp/Lamp (object).stl" download > Lamp object (Download) </a>
		<a href="/Lamp/Lamp (object).3mf" download > Cura (Download) </a>
		<a href="/Lamp/Lamp (object).gcode" download > gcode (Download) </a>
		
		
		<p> Currently, the lamp is an exposed bulb of a larger size, so I'll have to replace the bulb or account for that 
			sizing in my creation of the lamp shade.
		</p>
		<img src="/Lamp/lamp_measure3.jpg" width=350 >
		
		<p> Using the calipers, I measured the innerds and other dimensions of the base. 
		</p>

		<img src="/Lamp/lamp_measure2.jpg" width=230 >
		<img src="/Lamp/lamp_measure4.jpg" width=230 >
		
		<p> I soon realized that the size of the bulb would be a bit difficult to work with in creating 
			the shade so decided to use a smaller bulb from another lamp I have instead. That changed the 
			dimensions of my lampshade so I remeasured the shape. 
		</p>

		<p> I then started creating the lamp shape in Rhino. I created two tubes - one for the lamp and
			 one for the part that would hold onto the lamp inner and allow the lamp to rest on it. Using the 
			BooleanUnion command, I combined them into one object. 
		</p>
		<img src="/Lamp/Lamp (tubes).png" width=350 >
		<img src="/Lamp/Lamp (union tubes).png" width=350 >
		
		<p> Then I used the CreateUVCrv command to create the pattern that would fit the surface area of the lamp. 
		</p>
		<img src="/Lamp/Lamp (before pattern).png" width=350 >
		
		<p> I then used the arc tool to create the indententation that would cut into the surface. 
		 	The center point is the center of the object, the start is the point to the left and then the 
			curve goes below the plane. Then split the curve using the Split command and splitting it 
			perpendicular to the arc. I then created that surface by using the Sweep 2 Rails function and using 
			a point on both sides and the center of the arc. 
		</p>
		<img src="/Lamp/Lamp (arc).png" width=350 >
		
		<p> After creating this surface, I duplicated them using a rectangular array, creating a 7X4 grid pattern. I then selected 
			the plane (without selecting the objects in it) and used the planar surface command to create it into one plane with the objects. 
		</p>

		<img src="/Lamp/Lamp (pattern 1).png" width=230 >
		<img src="/Lamp/Lamp (pattern 2).png" width=230 >
		
		<p> I then used the flow along a surface command to place the pattern onto the lamp shadeâ€™s cylinder surface. And it's a lamp! 
		</p>
		<img src="/Lamp/Lamp (final design).png" width=350 >
		
		<p> I exported the STL and imported it into Cura to print. The estimated time was 6 hours and 14 minutes, and it ended up 
			printing in 6 hours and 8 minutes.  
		</p>
		<img src="/Lamp/Lamp (cura).png" width=350 >
		<img src="/Lamp/Lamp (in progress).jpg" width=350 >
		
		<p> The print came out well on the first try and fit the lamp innerd perfectly.

		<img src="/Lamp/Lamp (full).jpg" width=230 >
		
		
		<p> What I later realized was that there was a strong resemblance between the pattern I created to the 
			indented shape on the lamp base - this allowed it to fit well inside too! Let's just pretend that was by design :)

		<p> Here's how the final product looks when attached to the lamp base and innerd.
