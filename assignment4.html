            <h1>Assignment 4: Meshes and lamps </h1>
		<p> In this assignment, we were tasked to 1) modify the mesh of two STLs to produce a single printable STL and 2) 
      create a lamp design that can easily fit to the innerds and be disassembled. 
    </p>

  <h3>Part 1: Meshes</h3>
		<p> For the first part of the assignment, I decided to solve a problem I often run into - carrying credit cards without needing a bag. I wanted to create a credit card clip that would 
			attach to a belt or pocket without falling or slipping out of my pocket. I found an STL for a belt clip and another STL for a credit card clip
			and created a combined mesh as demonstrated in class.

		<a href="/Meshes/Reference STLs/Frame.STL" download > card holder reference file (Download) </a>
		<a href="/Meshes/Reference STLs/belt_clips.stl" download > belt clip reference file (Download) </a>
		
		<br> 
		
		<p> First, I imported both STL files into Rhino.

		<p> I then placed them in the orientation that I wanted them to print in, overlapping a bit so the union would work. 
		</p>

		<p> Next, I used the Show Edges command to check that there were no naked edges that I would have to fill. Luckily, there
			were no naked edges and I could move to create a union as is!

		<p> Finally, I used the MeshBooleanUnion command to create a union between the two objects.

    <h3>Part 2: Lamp design </h3>
		<p> For the second part of the assignment, I designed a lamp to fit onto my existing hanging lamp I had gotten from Ikea.
			I wanted to create a simple, minimal, geometric shape for my lamp shade and create something that would 
			fit well with the warm tones of my room and desk. Below are some mood board ideas that I looked to for inspiration.
