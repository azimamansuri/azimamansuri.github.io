            <h1>Assignment 6: Final project proposal </h1>
		<p> In this assignment, we were tasked to create a project plan to outline our final project. 
		</p>

	<h2>Concept </h2>	
	<p> For my final project, I wanted to build off of the mediterranean tile concept I had for my molding project. 
		My sister and I are creating a print shop and are in the process of creating ink prints that would be 
		used as cards, posters or gifts. For the mold project, I created two turkish-inspired tile design molds 
		to be used as stamps. For this final project, I’m hoping to create a cohesive collection to fit this theme. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		I’m planning out the collection, but would love to incorporate some arabic calligraphy/writing 
		into it as well to showcase the connectedness between the architecture, culture, and script of 
		the mediterranean, and found some inspiration online to create a moodboard:

		<p>
		Through this project, I want to experiment with different shapes and patterns that I can create through 
		different methods (rhino and grasshopper), and then print the mold which I plan to cast silicone into and then 
		plaster as a final piece. These objects would be used as stamps for these prints. 
		</p>
		
		
	<h2>Tasks </h2>
		<p> Here are a list of tasks that I've outlined to define my process. 
		</p>
		
	<h2>Timeline </h2>
		<p> To set expectations and give myself enough time to work through the steps and allow the molds to cure, 
		I've outlined the timeline for the final project and it's deliverables. These specifics may change if
		some parts of the process take longer than others/something goes wrong but I've estimated it based
		on the timeline of the projects we've done this quarter. 
		</p>
		
	<h2>Bill of materials </h2>
		<p>
		I will be using the remaining filament I have from class (since it will only be used for 
		the mold of molds), oomoo, plaster, watercolor paper, black ink, and a roller to 
		roll the ink onto the plaster stamp. I have rubber sheets if the plaster is too stiff to 
		transfer the ink over to the paper to carve and use if needed. I don’t anticipate needing 
		anything else that I don’t already have sourced!
