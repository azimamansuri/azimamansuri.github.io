             I'm a UX Designer at Microsoft working on the Internet of Things for Azure! I'm also moonlighting as a student in the HCDE Master's program. 
      		I'm excited to learn about designing physical forms, espectially applications to IoT. I'm more excited about getting to work with my hands again and learn the world of 3D printing! 
                I'm new to 3D printing do don't have much sage advice just yet, but can share what I've learned about visual design! If anyone's interested in exploring ways to apply 3D printing to interior design with me, let me know! :)
