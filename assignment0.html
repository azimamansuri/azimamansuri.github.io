            <h1>Assignment 0: Building a 3D printer</h1>
			
		<p>
		This is my first time building and using a 3D printer, so the initial set up took me quite some time (about 3 hours) - I didn't want to rush through the process so took my time with the build. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		I found a  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me8Qrwh907Q">great guide video</a> online that helped walk me through each of the steps of the process.

		<p> To level the bed of the printer, I followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eqTmb01cBk">another really helpful video </a> by the same account.  
		</p>

		<p> Overall, it was a relatively straightforward process for me that just took some time to get right - definitely had to redo some parts to adjust the leveling and tightness of the bolts!
