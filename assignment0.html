		<p>
		This is my first time building and using a 3D printer, so the initial set up took me quite some time (about 3 hours) - 
			I didn't want to rush through the process so took my time with the build. 
			Initially, I spent some time organizing all the pieces so I would be able to find what I needed. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		I found a  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me8Qrwh907Q">great guide video</a> online that helped walk me through each of the steps of the process. 
			In the video, he instructs on how to tighten and loosen the eccentric nuts so was extra careful to make sure those were properly in place.

		<p> To level the bed of the printer, I followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eqTmb01cBk">another really helpful video </a> by the same account.  
		</p>

		<p> Overall, it was a relatively straightforward process for me that just took some time to get right - definitely had to redo some parts to adjust the leveling and tightness of the bolts! Super excited to get started with printing!
