            <h1>Assignment 2: Designing cubes, tubes, and cylinders</h1>
		<p> In this assignment, we were tasked to create test prints and simple dimension shapes to get some practice with printing and the different settings available. 
			For some reason, when importing to Cura, the sizes translated into mm even when they were set as cm in Rhino, so I ended up converting it to match the cm scaling in Cura. 
		</p>
        
		<h3>Cubes</h3>
		<p> The first part of the assignment focused on printing a cube with varying qualities (low, standard, high) and one with a concentric top and bottom layer. This process took a bit of calibrating and tuning as the filament had issues sticking to the bed. 
		</p>

	<h3> A 2cm cube with the standard "low quality" settings and a brim 
		<a href="/Cura/Cube (low quality).gcode" download > (gcode) </a>
	</h3>
		
	<img src="Cura/Cube (low quality).png" width=250 >
	
	<p>
		For this print, I selected the low quality setting, decreased the initial layer print speed from 20 mm/s to 10 mm/s, 
		and added a brim build plate adhesion. 
		Initially the .stl file loaded in a mm unit so converted that to cm using the scaling. 
	</p>
	
		
	<h3> A 2cm cube with the standard "standard quality" settings and a brim
		<a href="/Cura/Cube (standard quality).gcode" download > (gcode) </a>
	</h3>	
	
	<img src="Cura/Cube (standard quality).png" width=250 >
		
	<p>
		For this print, I selected the standard quality setting, decreased the initial layer print speed 
		from 20 mm/s to 10 mm/s, and added a brim build plate adhesion. 
	</p>
		
			
	<h3> A 2cm cube with the standard "high quality" settings and a brim
		<a href="/Cura/Cube (high dynamic quality).gcode" download > (gcode) </a>
	</h3>	
		<img src="Cura/Cube (high dynamic quality).png" width=250 >
			
	<p>
		For this print, I selected the high quality setting (opting for the dynamic one), decreased the initial 
		layer print speed from 20 mm/s to 10 mm/s, and added a brim build plate adhesion. 
	</p>
		
		
	<h3> A 2cm cube with a concentric top and bottom layer
		<a href="/Cura/Cube (concentric).gcode" download > (gcode) </a>
	</h3>	
			
		<img src="Cura/Cube (concentric).png" width=250 >
		
	<p>
		For this print, I selected the standard quality setting, decreased the initial layer print speed from 20 mm/s to 10 mm/s, 
		and this time did not include a brim build plate adhesion. 
	</p>
		
	
<h3>Tubes</h3>
		
	<p> The second part of the assignment focused on printing tubes with two different extrusion wall thicknesses (single, double).  	 
	</p>
		
	<img src="Tube.png" width=250 >
	<a href="tube.stl" download > tube.stl (Download) </a>
		
	<h3> A tube 2cm in diameter and .5cm high with a single extrusion wall thickness
		<a href="/Single extrusion/Tube (single).gcode" download > (gcode) </a>
	</h3>	
		
		<img src="Single extrusion/Tube (single).png" width=250 >
			
	<p>
		For this tube, I set the wall thickness at 2mm (0.2cm). 
	</p>
		
	
	<h3> A tube 2cm in diameter and .5cm high with a double extrusion wall thickness and random z-seam alignment.
		<a href="/Double extrusion/Tube (double).gcode" download > (gcode) </a>
	</h3>
		
		<img src="Double extrusion/Tube (double).png" width=250 >
			
	<p>
		For this tube, I set the wall thickness at 4mm (0.4cm) with a random z-seam alignment. 
	</p>
		
		
		
	<h3>Cylinders</h3>
		
		<p> The third part of the assignment focused on printing cylinders with two different extrusion wall thicknesses (single, double).  	 
		</p>
		
		
	<img src="Cylinder.png" width=250 >
		<a href="/cylinder (0.1cm tolerance).stl" download > cylinder.stl (0.1cm tolerance) (Download) </a>
		<a href="/cylinder (0.005cm tolerance).stl" download > cylinder.stl (0.005cm tolerance) (Download) </a>
		
		
	<h3> A cylinder 2cm in diameter exported with a 0.1cm tolerance, printed on its round side with supports
		<a href="/Cylinder (0.1cm tolerance)/Cylinder (0.1cm tolerance).gcode" download > (gcode) </a>
	</h3>	
	
		<img src="/Cylinder (0.1cm tolerance)/Cylinder (0.1cm tolerance).png" width=250 >
		
		<p>
			For this cylinder, I rotated it on it's side after importing into Cura using the rotate tool and then added a support in the settings panel. 
		</p>
		
		
	<h3> A cylinder 2cm in in diameter exported with a 0.005cm tolerance
		<a href="/Cylinder (0.005cm tolerance)/Cylinder (0.005cm tolerance).gcode" download > (gcode) </a>
	</h3>	
		
		<img src="Cylinder (0.005cm tolerance)/Cylinder (0.005cm tolerance).png" width=250 >
		
		<p>
			For this cylinder, I left it upright as I had created it in Rhino to see if it would print differently when it was upright vs. on it's side. 
		</p>
			

<h3>Hollowed object</h3>
		
		<p> The last part of the assignment focused on printing a cube with a hole through it, 
		</p>
		
		
	<h3> 20.0mm +/- 0.5mm cube with a 5.0mm +/- 0.5mm hole through it
	</h3>	
			
	<p>
	</p>
