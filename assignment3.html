            <h1>Assignment 3: Clips and nested objects</h1>
		<p> In this assignment, we were tasked to create clips and nested objects using grasshopper. Documented below is the process for creating both of these printed objects.  
		    From the demos in class, I was amazed at the wide variety of things we can do in grasshopper and was excited to play around with it this week! I found it relatively easy to experiment with, and didn't have any major difficulties with the program itself.

  <h3>Part 1: Clips</h3>
		<p> For the first part of the assigment, I designed clips that would hold together card board (but more usefully, credit cards!)

    <h3>Part 2: Nested objects </h3>
		<p> For the second part of the assigment, I designed tiny objects that fit togther and are 3D printed together but come apart.
