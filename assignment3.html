            <h1>Assignment 3: Clips and nested objects</h1>
		<p> In this assignment, we were tasked to create clips and nested objects using grasshopper. Documented below is the process for creating both of these printed objects.  
		    From the demos in class, I was amazed at the wide variety of things we can do in grasshopper and was excited to play around with it this week! I found it relatively easy to experiment with, and didn't have any major difficulties with the program itself.

  <h3>Part 1: Clips</h3>
		<p> For the first part of the assigment, I designed clips that would hold together card board (but more usefully, credit cards!)

    <h3>Part 2: Nested objects </h3>
		<p> For the second part of the assigment, I designed a pentagon shaped object that fit togther in a nested form - 
			the entire nested structure was printed together but each piece comes apart.

		<p> Following the tutorial shared in slack, I created this shape using a grasshopper definition, shown below. 
			I started by creating a definition of a curve and the offset curves and then extruding the walls up.
			The method I used here was to create lists and then merge them into list groupings so that the walls 
			extruded are joined with their base plate surfaces below using a union command. This allows them to separate as individual objects but still be printed together.

		<p> The overall process of setting up the rhino and grasshopper models was pretty straightforward and super interesting, thanks to the great tutorial!
		    I then exported the files and imported the STL file into Cura to translate into machine code (gcode) for the printer.
