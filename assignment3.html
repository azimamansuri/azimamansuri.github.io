            <h1>Assignment 3: Clips and nested objects</h1>
		<p> In this assignment, we were tasked to create clips and nested objects using grasshopper. Documented below is the process for creating both of these printed objects.  
		    From the demos in class, I was amazed at the wide variety of things we can do in grasshopper and was excited to play around with it this week! I found it relatively easy to experiment with, and didn't have any major difficulties with the program itself. 
    </p>

  <h3>Part 1: Clips</h3>
		<p> For the first part of the assigment, I designed clips that would hold together card board (but more usefully, credit cards!)
		</p>
		
		<a href="/Clips/clips.stl" download > Clips STL (Download) </a>
		<a href="/Clips/clips.3dm" download > Rhino (Download) </a>
		<a href="/Clips/clips.gh" download > Grasshopper definition (Download) </a>
		<a href="/Clips/clips.3mf" download > Cura (Download) </a>
		<a href="/Clips/clips.gcode" download > gcode (Download) </a>
		
		<br> 
		
		<p> I created this shape in using the grasshopper definition, starting by creating a simple vector polygon in Rhino 
			using the vector tool and then defined the extrusion and turned it into a solid using the cap holes in grasshopper. 
			I extruded to 7 points in the z direction using the number slider. 
		</p>

		<p> I then exported the clip's .stl file into Cura.

		<p> This clip took 1 hour and 20 seconds to print - it printed cleanly for the most part, but about 1/3 way through, 
		    there seemed to be a slight layer shift happening so will look into what was causing that issue. 
		</p>

    <h3>Part 2: Nested objects </h3>
		<p> For the second part of the assigment, I designed a pentagon shaped object that fit togther in a nested form - 
			the entire nested structure was printed together but each piece comes apart.  
		</p>
		
		<a href="/Nested Objects/NestedObject.stl" download > Nested Object STL (Download) </a>
		<a href="/Nested Objects/NestedObject.3dm" download > Rhino (Download) </a>
		<a href="/Nested Objects/nested objects.gh" download > Grasshopper definition (Download) </a>
		<a href="/Nested Objects/NestedObject.3mf" download > Cura (Download) </a>
		<a href="/Nested Objects/NestedObject.gcode" download > gcode (Download) </a>
		
		<br>
		
		<img src="/Nested Objects/nested object (rhino + gh).png" width=700 >
		
		<p> Following the tutorial shared in slack, I created this shape using a grasshopper definition, shown below. 
			I started by creating a definition of a curve and the offset curves and then extruding the walls up.
			The method I used here was to create lists and then merge them into list groupings so that the walls 
			extruded are joined with their base plate surfaces below using a union command. This allows them to separate as individual objects but still be printed together. 
		</p>

		<img src="/Nested Objects/nested object (wireframe).png" width=350 >
		<img src="/Nested Objects/nested object (perspective view).png" width=350 >
		
		<p> These surfaces were created and baked to set as individual structures. 
		</p>

		<img src="/Nested Objects/nested object (zoomed in).png" width=233 height=233>
		
		<p> The overall process of setting up the rhino and grasshopper models was pretty straightforward and super interesting, thanks to the great tutorial!
		    I then exported the files and imported the STL file into Cura to translate into machine code (gcode) for the printer. 
		</p>

		<img src="/Nested Objects/nested object (cura preview).png" width=350 >
		
		<p> In Cura, I removed the bottom thickness so that the pieces within the nested object could be removed individually. 
		Something weird did happen with the print initially - while it was sticking perfectly well, it initially printed in another coordinate before moving to the space it stayed in. 
			This might have been a brim that I didn't disable but unsure why it printed in another location when it did not show that in the preview for Cura.
